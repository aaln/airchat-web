# Airchat Web Client

An unofficial web client for the innovative Airchat app, designed to integrate with the Airchat API. This project serves as an open-source initiative, providing a reference for developers interested in interfacing with Airchat's capabilities. While the official Airchat app currently lacks a web client and a public API, this project aims to fill that gap and invites contributions from the community.
